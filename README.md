# BrainHackApp
Contains our text/shell based program as well as a partially functioning GUI variant.

BrainhackShell.py is the functional program our team created as a proof of concept of our vision of the ideal scheduling app.
BrainhackGUI(Incomplete).py is a partially developed port based on the original BrainhackShell.py that was intended to incorporate the tkinter python module to create an 
interactive Graphical User Interface that to make usability easier.

Both .py files can be directly run, with BrainhackShell.py using the console for user input and output.
